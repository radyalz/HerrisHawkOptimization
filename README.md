# HerrisHawkOptimization
This repository serves as a review resource for my PhD research conducted in 2024, which focused on Harris Hawk Optimization. Inside, you'll find links to the published article, my implementation of the algorithm, and a bilingual PowerPoint presentation created for the review.

I hope this resource proves helpful to anyone interested in the topic. Feedback and discussions are welcome, as this is an open repository.
