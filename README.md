# 🦅 Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO)  
Welcome to the **Harris Hawk Optimization** repository, a comprehensive resource based on my 2024 PhD research. Dive into the world of HHO, an exciting metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the cooperative hunting strategy of Harris hawks!  

This repository includes:  
- 📄 Links to the published main article.  
- 💻 My implementation of the algorithm.  
- 🌐 A bilingual PowerPoint presentation (English & Farsi) created for the research review.  

I hope these resources are helpful for enthusiasts and researchers alike. Feel free to share your thoughts, start discussions, or suggest improvements—this is an open repository for everyone to learn and grow!

## 🛠 How to Level Up Your Repository  

1. **Add a Demo or Visualization:**  
   Include a simple demo (e.g., an interactive notebook or web app) showcasing how HHO works with visualizations of its optimization process.

2. **Improve Documentation:**  
   - Use badges for quick information (e.g., project status, license, programming language).  
   - Add a **Getting Started** section with steps to run your implementation.  

3. **Provide Code Examples:**  
   Include step-by-step usage examples for your HHO implementation to make it beginner-friendly.  

4. **Create a Wiki:**  
   Expand content into a GitHub Wiki with detailed sections like "HHO Applications," "Algorithm Variants," and "Performance Comparisons."  

5. **Engage with the Community:**  
   Add a **Contributing.md** file to encourage contributions. Create an "Issues" section for suggestions, questions, or bug reports.

6. **Add Visual Content:**  
   Use diagrams, flowcharts, or animations to explain the HHO process and its inspiration. Tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) or [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e) can help.

7. **Link Code to Research:**
